Team 57

We have solutionized the blockchain implementation for Govt and B2B sealed-bid based auction tendering system. 

The auctioner creates an event where the details about the bidding amount, eligibility criteria are captured and the relevant Smart contract is created. 

The Smart contract goes live at the specified time, and the eligible bidders are selected and get a chance to place the bids. 

The bidding amounts are sealed and tamperring is close to impossible even by the sys admin and the auctioner. 

The gives transparency on who the eligible bidder is and who the winning bidder is.
